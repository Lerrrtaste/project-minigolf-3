#### TODOS


- fix bug if incorrect player sents finished turn 104 it should not be recognized by server
- simple match end screen
- water tiles + ball reset
- sand tiles + speed slowdown
- Button Sprite (Disabled, Normal, Hovered, Clicked)
- 9 Patch Panel (InGame)
- Editor Icons (PlaceObj, RemoveObj, PlaceTile, RemoveTile)
- Editor Tool Bar
- Background 
- store maps in nakama collection
- map storage node to handle downloading / loading mapfile
- variable shot strenght
- wait for map to (down)load before starting match
- Final MVP export :)

#### DONE


- ball physics (vector reflection)
- BALL_IMPACT broadcast state data is not deserialized correctly yet, then:
- networked ball movement (remote pc) + synchronize at the end
- authorative turns
- consolidate bal
- FINISH_MOVE does not l spawn code
- stroke counter uiget sent reliable after sending REACHED_FINISH, is that is fixed, the win condition should work
- win condition


#### Notes
Atm solid only solid tiles have a collision shape on tilemap (solid TILE_DATA prop does nothing)

Wall sprite verdeckt wasser, etwas niedriger?

#### IDEAS
- Ball to Wall collision normal with 4 spheres / ray casts? Only if current does not work
- Match camera follows current player instead of local player
