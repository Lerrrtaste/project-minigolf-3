#### TODOS


- wait for map to (down)load before starting match
- player move impact should be normalized and controller by server (so mouse distance till max force can be client independent)
- ball to ball collisison (turned off when reached finished and before first shot)
- handle presence events (only leaves)

- ingame info popup (for limit reached, ingame events, errors etc)
- walls shouldnt hide water
- enforce objects only non solid, non resetting tiles (and remove when tile removed)
- Background 
- fix practive mode
- dont remove finished players from ingame panel (maybe icon prefix)
- test if tiles as nodes work (for juicy effects and better collision and better tile property detection
- use alternative wall normal calculation (old implementaion wonky at some angles)
- Final MVP export :)


#### DONE
- store maps in nakama collection
- map storage node to handle downloading / loading mapfile


- Editor Tool Bar
- ball name tag
- simple match end screen
- refactor map and editor to use only id as key
- variable shot strenght
- Button Sprite (Disabled, Normal, Hovered, Clicked)
- 9 Patch Panel (InGame)
- Editor Icons (PlaceObj, RemoveObj, PlaceTile, RemoveTile)
- ball physics (vector reflection)
- BALL_IMPACT broadcast state data is not deserialized correctly yet, then:
- networked ball movement (remote pc) + synchronize at the end
- authorative turns
- consolidate bal
- FINISH_MOVE does not l spawn code
- stroke counter uiget sent reliable after sending REACHED_FINISH, is that is fixed, the win condition should work
- win condition
- fix bug if incorrect player sents finished turn 104 it should not be recognized by server
- water tiles + ball reset
- sand tiles + speed slowdown

#### Notes
Map name requirements: min 4 max 16 chars

Atm solid only solid tiles have a collision shape on tilemap (solid TILE_DATA prop does nothing)
Maybe save MapMetadata and full map tiles+objects in seperate collections (only if loading the whole map for only displaying name etc is too much)
Wall sprite verdeckt wasser, etwas niedriger?

UI Pixel Scale 400%

#### IDEAS (Alpha)
- Ball to Wall collision normal with 4 spheres / ray casts? Only if current does not work
- Match camera follows current player instead of local player
- every player gets a color
- screen border / ingame stats panel borader in current players color
- "in matchmaking" screen
- "loading map" screen
- emotes (zb kenney pack)
- One Match Scene per GameMode (Practice Match, DefaultMatch) (Match Node should only handly gamemode specific things, everything else in other nodes, that should work standalone) 
- paging for maps
#### OP CODES
101 MATCH_CONFIG (map_id:int)
		sender: server

102 MATCH_START (joined_players:List presences, turn_order:List user_ids )
		sender: server
		note: implies next turn for first player in turn_order

103 NEXT_TURN (next_player:Dictionary presence)
		sender: server
		after recieving a FINISHED_TURN the next player is announced

104 FINISHED_TURN (reached_finish:bool)
		sender: client
		after ball stopped moving (because of friction or reaching the finish)

105 REACHED_FINISH ()
		sender: server
		if reached_finish in the FINISHED_TURN msg was true

106 MATCH_END (scores:Dictionary key userid, value shots)


// Ball Movement
201 BALL_IMPACT (target_pos:Vector2 relative click)
		sender: client (local playercontroller)
		reciever: remote pc
		note: impact meaining local player initiated move (not collision from another player)
