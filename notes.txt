#### TODOS

- show editor controls somewhere

- enforce objects only non solid, non resetting tiles (and remove when tile removed)
- test if tiles as nodes work (for juicy effects and better collision and better tile property detection
- fix practive mode
- hide balls behind walls

- handle presence events (only leaves)
- end authorative matches after x time when everyone left

- finalize match end screen
- main menu ui + map selection


- Final MVP export :)


#### DONE
- Background 
- walls shouldnt hide water
- Main Menu UI
- editor popup close button sprite
- login screen
- set guest account metadata guest=true

- (fix / ) rewrite turn order to be used equally by server and client
- end authorative matches properly (return nil in match_loop does not work)
- ingame info popup (for limit reached, ingame events, errors etc)
- player move impact should be normalized and controller by server (so mouse distance till max force can be client independent)
- wait for map to (down)load before starting match
- ball to ball collisison (turned off when reached finished and before first shot)
- fixed wall collisions
- dont remove finished players from ingame panel (maybe icon prefix)
- store maps in nakama collection
- map storage node to handle downloading / loading mapfile
- Editor Tool Bar
- ball name tag
- simple match end screen
- refactor map and editor to use only id as key
- variable shot strenght
- Button Sprite (Disabled, Normal, Hovered, Clicked)
- 9 Patch Panel (InGame)
- Editor Icons (PlaceObj, RemoveObj, PlaceTile, RemoveTile)
- ball physics (vector reflection)
- BALL_IMPACT broadcast state data is not deserialized correctly yet, then:
- networked ball movement (remote pc) + synchronize at the end
- authorative turns
- consolidate bal
- FINISH_MOVE does not l spawn code
- stroke counter uiget sent reliable after sending REACHED_FINISH, is that is fixed, the win condition should work
- win condition
- fix bug if incorrect player sents finished turn 104 it should not be recognized by server
- water tiles + ball reset
- sand tiles + speed slowdown
- delete guest accounts occasionally (sql query in run once?)


#### Notes

Map name requirements: min 4 max 16 chars

Atm solid only solid tiles have a collision shape on tilemap (solid TILE_DATA prop does nothing)
Maybe save MapMetadata and full map tiles+objects in seperate collections (only if loading the whole map for only displaying name etc is too much)
Wall sprite verdeckt wasser, etwas niedriger?

UI Pixel Scale 400%


#### IDEAS (Alpha)

- Ball to Wall collision normal with 4 spheres / ray casts? Only if current does not work
- Match camera follows current player instead of local player
- every player gets a color
- screen border / ingame stats panel borader in current players color
- "in matchmaking" screen
- "loading map" screen
- emotes (zb kenney pack)
- One Match Scene per GameMode (Practice Match, DefaultMatch) (Match Node should only handly gamemode specific things, everything else in other nodes, that should work standalone) 
- paging for maps
- map rating (thumbs up/down) at the end
- show map rating in editor
- icon prefix for finished players in ingame panel
- Trees
- Balls have juicy eyes and smile when they hit each other (with sound) (emoji golf?) and the eyes roll with the ball (up+down / left+right)
- Map deltetion only a flag, remove after x days (to be able to restore maps with console access)
- itch io page (cover, banner, screenshots, html player....)
- Vote for next map
- Map playlists
- fixed maps
- "conveyor belt" tiles in all directions
- "death" tiles that reset to spawn (lava?)
- ice tiles with lower friction
- sticky walls
- bouncy walls
- "claim" guest username when logged in as guest (register)
- account / "profile" screen to change display name, mail, password etc 
- statistics on profile page (as player and as map creator)

		sender: client (local playercontroller)
		reciever: remote pc

#### Scrap

<- config (map+owner)
-> client ready
<- match start (joined_players, turn order) (implies next_turn)

-> finished turn (reached_finish)
<- next turn (presence (should be id))

	-> ball_impact (impact_vec)
	-> ball_sync (synced_pos)

-> finished turn (reached_finish true)
<- reached_finish (sender -> finished player)

<- match end (results)
