Next Todos:

- authorative turns
- consolidate ball spawn code
- stroke counter ui
- win condition
- simple match end screen
- water tiles + ball reset
- sand tiles + speed slowdown
- store maps in nakama collection
- map storage node to handle downloading / loading mapfile



DONE
- ball physics (vector reflection)
- BALL_IMPACT broadcast state data is not deserialized correctly yet, then:
- networked ball movement (remote pc) + synchronize at the end



IDEAS
- Ball to Wall collision normal with 4 spheres / ray casts? Only if current does not work
